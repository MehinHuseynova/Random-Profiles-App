# Random Profiles Web Interface

## Overview

## Features

* Delete Button: Each profile has a delete button, allowing users to remove individual profiles from the list.

* Reload Button: Clicking this button replaces all previously fetched profiles with 20 new ones.

* More/Close Profile Details: Each profile has a toggle button to show additional details. At least 5 more data points from the API are displayed.
